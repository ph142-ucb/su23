## Extra Credit - Question Creation

If you would like to recover points lost on the first or second midterm you have the option of an extra credit
assignment. To recover up to 3 marks on the midterm, reinforce your understanding, and to show your
creativity, you can make a short explanation of a concept from the course that includes sample question and
solution guide corresponding to topics covered during that lecture.
