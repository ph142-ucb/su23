My name is Nakato Zora Joy from Uganda, East Africa. I am an MA Biostatistics student at UC Berkeley school of public health. I did my undergraduate studies at Makerere University where I majored in Mathematics and minored in Physics. Prior to joining Berkeley, I was working with the Data and Statistics department at UVRI-IAVI HIV vaccine program which is a research organization conducting clinical trials for HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses. I am interested in development and application of statistical methodologies for analyzing data in biological research to draw the most meaningful insights that inform public health policy. My research interests include causal inference, Machine learning applications in biomedical research, precision medicine and Clinical trials. I speak English, Luganda and a bit of German. I love reading, music and cooking.
