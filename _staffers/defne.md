Hi everyone! My name is Defne Yilmaz (she/her) and I was born and raised in San Diego, CA. I'm a second-year Epidemiology PhD student in the Barcellos lab researching genetic determinants of disease expression in autoimmune diseases. I have an MS in Epidemiology from UCLA and a BA in Public Health from Berkeley (Go Bears!!). In my spare time, I enjoy listening to records, cooking, road biking, hiking, surfing, spending time outside with family and friends, and playing with my dog. I am super excited to work with you all this semester!!
