Hi everyone! My name is Iris and I am a rising senior studying Public Health and Data Science. I am passionate about public health implications in low-income and unhoused populations, and gender-based violence prevention.  In my free time, I love playing basketball, hiking, and seeing my favorite artists at concerts. Feel free to reach out about any issues you may have with Datahub or any other questions. Looking forward to meeting everyone this summer!
