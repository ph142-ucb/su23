Hi everyone! I am a 2nd year PhD student in Epidemiology. I enjoy how biostatistics can help researchers sharpen their questions, and look forward a lot to teaching PH142 with all other GSIs! In my own time, I like reading, cooking, and live with a sneaky black cat. I am moving back to the city and have worked in SF for 2 years. Ask me for good SF bookstore and coffee shop recommendations!
