Hello everyone! I’m Nolan and I’m a first year MA/PhD Biostatistics student. I’m originally from the Seattle area and recently graduated with my bachelor’s in mathematics and economics from Oregon State University. I’m interested in epidemiology, HIV/AIDS, neuroimaging and causal inference research. In my free time I enjoy gardening, reading, and reality TV! Looking forward to working with you all!

Also fluent in: French
