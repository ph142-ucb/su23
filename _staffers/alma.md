Hi guys! I am a DrPH candidate. My research is on gender-based violence in Mexico, from the alterations in subclinical markers to femicides in Mexico. My background is in Economics and Public Policy at the University of Chicago. I have experience as a GSI in this course, as well as a tutor. I loves my dog Rocky and BTS, my bias is Taehyung. I am looking forward to supporting your learning in either Spanish or English!

Also fluent in: Spanish
