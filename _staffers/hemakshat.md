My name is Hemakshat Sharma. I am an incoming 4+1 MPH student in Epidemiology. In undergrad, I took MCB and Public Health. I've done research in neurological conditions at UCSF where I've actually been able to use the techniques taught in PH 142 to develop data analyzing pipelines.In my spare time, I enjoy playing volleyball and basketball so you'll probably see me at RSF. I look forward to meeting you all!
